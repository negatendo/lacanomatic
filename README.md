===================================

Twitter bot inspired by the tweets of [@peterpcullen](https://twitter.com/peterpcullen), the code behind [@MuseumBot](https://twitter.com/MuseumBot), and [Jacques Lacan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Lacan). 

See it on twitter: [@lacanomatic](https://twitter.com/lacanomatic).

To make the bot tweet, you need to load the URL that includes the secret BOT_ENDPOINT. I set up a chron schedule on an outside server to do this every 6 hours.
